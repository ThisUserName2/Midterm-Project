# Hobbies

## Art

I currently have two hobbies at this time. My hobbies are Art and card collection. I am currently trying to improve my abilltys with digital arts so most of the art that I am woring on right now are all digital. Even with most of my art now being digital one of my favorite art medias are oil pastels and chalks. I find these two media are the most fun in traditional art.

## Card Collection

When it comes to my card collection hobbie I mainly collect Pokemon cards because I have always enjoyed pokemon. I find completing an entire set to be very satisfying and unpacking a very rare card is exciting. I don't think I would enjoy collecting pokemon cards if I did not enjoy the art work, I never really got into playing the card game. I enjoy playing card games but the ones I play are all digital.
